  "“Nothing appears more surprising to those, who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers.",
  "When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that, as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion.",
  "It is therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular.” — David Hume",

  "Ketika kita menyelidiki dengan cara apa keajaiban ini terwujud, kita akan mendapati bahwa, karena Kekuatan selalu berada di pihak yang diperintah, para penguasa tak memiliki sandaran apa pun selain opini.",

  "The upside of being born on reaping day is that you can sleep late on your birthday.",
  "It’s pretty much downhill from there.",
  "A day off school hardly compensates for the terror of the name drawing.",
  "Even if you survive that, nobody feels like having cake after watching two kids being hauled off to the Capitol for slaughter.",
  "I roll over and pull the sheet over my head.",

  "You said you wanted to get to the woods at daylight.”",
  "",
  "It’s true.",
  "I’m hoping to finish my work before the ceremony so I can devote the afternoon to the two things I love best — wasting time and being with my girl, Lenore Dove.",
  "My ma makes indulging in either of these a challenge, since she regularly announces that no job is too hard or dirty or tricky for me, and even the poorest people can scrape up a few pennies to dump their misery on somebody else.",
  "But given the dual occasions of the day, I think she’ll allow for a bit of freedom as long as my work is done.",
  "It’s the Gamemakers who might ruin my plans.",

  "“All right, all right.",
  "I’m up, too.”",
  "I roll straight off the mattress onto the floor and pull on a pair of shorts made from a government- issued flour sack.",
  "The words courtesy of the capitol end up stamped across my butt.",
  "My ma wastes nothing.",
  "Widowed young when my pa died in a coal mine fire, she’s raised Sid and me by taking in laundry and making every bit of anything count.",
  "The hardwood ashes in the fire pit are saved for lye soap.",
  "Eggshells get ground up to fertilize the garden.",
  "Someday these shorts will be torn into strips and woven into a rug.",
  "",
  "I finish dressing and toss Sid back in his bed, where he burrows right down in the patchwork quilt.",
  "In the kitchen, I grab a piece of corn bread, an upgrade for my birthday instead of the gritty, dark stuff made from the Capitol flour.",
  "Out back, my ma’s already stirring a steaming kettle of clothes with a stick, her muscles straining as she flips a pair of miner’s overalls.",
  "She’s only thirty-five, but life’s sorrows have already cut lines into her face, like they do.",
  "",
  "Ma catches sight of me in the doorway and wipes her brow.",
  "“Happy sixteenth.",
  "Sauce on the stove.”",
  "",
  "“Thanks, Ma.”",
  "I find a saucepan of stewed plums and scoop some on my bread before I head out.",
  "I found these in the woods the other day, but it’s a nice surprise to have them all hot and sugared.",
  "",
  "“Need you to fill the cistern today,” Ma says as I pass.",
  "",
  "We’ve got cold running water, only it comes out in a thin stream that would take an age to fill a bucket.",
  "There’s a special barrel of pure rainwater she charges extra for because the clothes come out softer, but she uses our well water for most of the laundry.",
  "What with pumping and hauling, filling the cistern’s a two-hour job even with Sid’s help.",
  "",
  "“Can’t it wait until tomorrow?”",
  "I ask.",
  "",
  "“I’m running low and I’ve got a mountain of wash to do,” she answers.",
  "",
  "“This afternoon, then,” I say, trying to hide my frustration.",
  "If the reaping’s done by one, and assuming we’re not part of this year’s sacrifice, I can finish the water by three and still see Lenore Dove.",
  "",
  "A blanket of mist wraps protectively around the worn, gray houses of the Seam.",
  "It would be soothing if it wasn’t for the scattered cries of children being chased in their dreams.",
  "In the last few weeks, as the Fiftieth Hunger Games has drawn closer, these sounds have become more frequent, much like the anxious thoughts I work hard to keep at bay.",
  "The second Quarter Quell.",
  "Twice as many kids.",
  "No point in worrying, I tell myself, there’s nothing you can do about it.",
  "Like two Hunger Games in one.",
  "No way to control the outcome of the reaping or what follows it.",
  "So don’t feed the nightmares.",
  "Don’t let yourself panic.",
  "Don’t give the Capitol that.",
  "They’ve taken enough already.",
  "",
  "I follow the empty cinder street to the hill with the miners’ graveyard.",
  "A jumble of rough markers spikes the slope.",

  "My pa’s buried in the family plot.",
  "A patch of Abernathys, with one limestone marker doing for us all.",
  "",
  "After a quick check for witnesses — no one’s here much, and certainly not at dawn — I crawl under the fence into the woods outside District 12 and begin the trek to the still.",
  "Brewing white liquor with Hattie Meeney is dicey business, but it’s a picnic compared to killing rats or cleaning outhouses.",
  "She expects me to work hard, but she works hard herself, and even though she’ll never see sixty again, she can do more than a person half her age.",
  "There’s a lot of grunt work involved.",
  "Collecting firewood, hauling grain, taking in the full bottles and toting back the empties to be refilled.",
  "That’s where I come in.",
  "I’m Hattie’s mule.",
  "",
  "I stop at what we call the depot, a bare patch of ground concealed by the drooping boughs of a willow tree, where Hattie drops off supplies.",
  "Two twenty-five-pound sacks of cracked corn await, and I swing one over each shoulder.",
  "",
  "It takes about half an hour to reach the still, where I find Hattie tending a pot of mash next to the remains of a small fire.",
  "",
  "She offers me her long-handled wooden spoon.",
  "“Why don’t you give this a stir?”",
  "",
  "I drop the bags of corn under a lean-to where we keep supplies and raise the spoon in victory.",
  "“Whoa, a promotion!”",
  "",
  "Me being allowed to handle the mash is something new.",
  "Maybe Hattie’s starting to train me to be a partner one day.",
  "Two of us brewing full-time would increase output, and there’s always more demand than she can meet, even for the eye-watering stuff she makes with the Capitol grain.",
  "Particularly for that, since it’s cheap enough for the miners to afford.",
  "The good stuff gets bought up by disorderly soldiers — Peacekeepers, that is — and the richer folk in town.",
  "But bootlegging’s illegal ten different ways, and all it would take is a new Head Peacekeeper — one who didn’t like a stiff drink himself — to land us in the stocks or worse.",
  "Mining’s tough work, but they don’t hang you for it.",
  "",
  "While Hattie packs pint bottles of white liquor into a basket lined with moss, I squat down and stir the mash on and off.",
  "When it’s cooled some, I pour it into a deep bucket and she adds the yeast.",
  "I set the mash in the lean-to so it can ferment.",
  "She’s not distilling today since she doesn’t want to risk the smoke attracting attention if the mist burns off.",
  "Our local Peacekeepers may turn a blind eye to Hattie’s still and her stall in the Hob, an old warehouse that serves as our black market, but she’s worried their Capitol counterparts in their low-flying, cloaked hovercraft will spot us from the air.",
  "No hauling in the bottles today either, so I’m tasked with chopping wood for the week.",
  "When the pile’s replenished, I ask what else needs doing, and she just shakes her head.",
  "",
  "Hattie’s endeared herself to me by throwing in a tip sometimes.",
  "Not with my wages, which she pays directly to my mother, but by slipping me a little something on the sly.",
  "A handful of cracked corn I can take to Lenore Dove for her geese, a packet of yeast I can barter with at the Hob, and today a pint of white liquor for my own use.",
  "She gives me her broken-toothed grin and says, “Happy birthday, Haymitch.",
  "I figure if you’re old enough to make it, you’re old enough to drink it.”",
  "",
  "I have to agree and, though I’m not a drinker myself, I’m glad to get the bottle.",
  "I can easily sell it or trade it or possibly pass it on to Lenore Dove’s uncle, Clerk Carmine, so that he might have a kinder opinion of me.",
  "You’d think the son of a washerwoman would be harmless enough, but we Abernathys were known rebels back in the day, and apparently we still carry the scent of sedition, scary and seductive in equal parts.",
  "Rumors spread after my father’s death, rumors that the fire had not been an accident.",
  "Some say he died sabotaging the mine, others that his crew was targeted by the Capitol bosses for being a pack of troublemakers.",
  "So it could be my kin’s the problem.",
  "Not that Clerk Carmine has any love for the Peacekeepers, but he’s not one for yanking their chain either.",
  "Or maybe he just doesn’t like his niece running around with a bootlegger, even if the work’s steady.",
  "Well, whatever the reason, he rarely gives me more than a terse nod, and he once told Lenore Dove that I was the kind that died young, which I don’t think he meant as a recommendation.",
  "",
  "Hattie yelps as I impulsively give her a hug.",
  "“Oh, enough of that.",
  "You still sparking that Covey girl?”",
  "",
  "“I’m sure trying,” I say, laughing.",
  "",
  "“Go bother her, then.",
  "You’re of no more use to me today.”",
  "She dumps a scoop of cracked corn into my hand and shoos me away.",
  "I pocket the corn and take off before she can change her mind about her best gift: unexpected time with my girl.",
  "I know I should probably head home and get a jump on filling the cistern, but I can’t resist the thought of a few stolen kisses.",
  "It’s my birthday and, for once, that cistern can wait.",
  "",
  "The mist begins to thin as I run through the woods to the Meadow.",
  "Most people comment on its beauty, but Lenore Dove calls it the friend of the condemned, because it can hide you from the Peacekeepers.",
  "She tends to take a dark view of things, but maybe that’s to be expected from someone named for a dead girl.",
  "Well, half for the dead girl called Lenore in this old poem and half for a shade of gray, which I found out the day I met her.",
  "",
  "It was the fall after I’d turned ten and the first time I’d ever snuck under the fence that surrounds our district.",
  "I’d been deterred by both the law and the threat of wild predators, which are rare but real.",
  "My friend Burdock had finally worn me down, saying he did it all the time and there was nothing to it and there were still apples if you could climb.",
  "And I could climb and I loved apples.",
  "Plus, him being younger than me made me feel like a big scaredy-cat if I didn’t.",
  "",
  "“Want to hear something?”",
  "Burdock asked as we ventured deep into the woods.",
  "He tilted back his head and sang out in that remarkable voice of his.",
  "High and sweet like a grown-up woman’s but cleaner, nothing warbly about it.",
  "Everything seemed to go still, and then the mockingjays began to pick it up.",
  "I knew they’d sing for other birds, but I’d never heard them sing for a person before.",
  "Pretty impressive stuff.",
  "Until an apple dropped smack on Burdock’s head, cutting him off.",
  "",
  "“Who’s squawking at my birds?”",
  "a girl’s voice demanded.",
  "And there she was, about twenty feet up, sprawled out on the branch like she lived there.",
  "Crooked pigtails, dirty bare feet, munching on an apple, a small clothbound book in her hand.",
  "",
  "Burdock cocked his head and laughed.",
  "“Hey, cuz.",
  "You allowed out here alone?",
  "’Cause I’m sure not.”",
  "",
  "“Well, I didn’t see you,” she said.",
  "",
  "“Me you either.",
  "Toss us down some, would you?”",
  "",
  "In answer she stood up on her branch and began to bounce up and down, showering us with apples.",
  "",
  "“Hang on, I’ve got a sack with my bow.”",
  "Burdock ran off.",
  "She scooted down the branches and swung to the ground.",
  "She wasn’t one of Burdock’s Everdeen cousins, but I knew he had some distant ones on his ma’s side.",
  "I’d seen her around at school — kind of shy, I thought, but I didn’t know her to speak to.",
  "She didn’t seem in a rush to change that, just stood there looking me over until I broke the silence.",
  "",
  "“I’m Haymitch.”",

  "Dove color: Warm gray with a slight purplish or pinkish tint.",
  "Her color.",
  "Her bird.",
  "Her name.",
  "",
  "After that, I started to notice things about her.",
  "How her faded overalls and shirts concealed snips of color, a bright blue handkerchief peeking from her pocket, a raspberry ribbon stitched inside her cuff.",
  "How she finished up her lessons quick, but didn’t make a fuss about it, just stared out the window.",
  "Then I spotted her fingers moving, pressing down imaginary keys.",
  "Playing songs.",
  "Her foot slipped from her shoe, her stockinged heel keeping time, silent against the wood floor.",
  "Like all the Covey, music in her blood.",
  "But not like them, too.",
  "Less interested in pretty melodies, more in dangerous words.",
  "The kind that lead to rebel acts.",
  "The kind that got her arrested twice.",
  "She was only twelve then, and they let her go.",
  "Now it would be different.",

  "As I reach the Meadow, I slip under the fence and pause to catch my breath and drink in the sight of Lenore Dove perched on her favorite rock.",
  "The sunlight picks up the hint of red in her hair as she bends over an ancient piano accordion.",

  "Lou Lou’s gone from averting her eyes to watching us constantly, as if she’s trying to piece together a puzzle.",
  "She tugs on her ear a lot, which makes me wonder if it hurts, because that’s what Sid used to do when he had an earache.",

  "During the Dark Days, the Capitol spied on us with jabberjays, mutts that looked like regular birds but could record the rebels’ conversations and play them back word for word.",
  "We figured this out and fed them false information.",
  "The Capitol released the jabberjays at the end of the war, thinking they’d die off, which they did, but not before they’d sired a whole new species by mating with female mockingbirds, creating Lenore Dove’s precious mockingjays.",
  "Now I guess Lou Lou is our own little jabberjay.",
  "",
  "When we join the other Newcomers in the gym, Lou Lou draws some questioning looks, but they seem to buy that she’s our girl, only brain-damaged.",

  "Untung aku dijadwalkan tampil terakhir, karena aku sama sekali tidak tahu bagaimana menghadapi Gamemaker.",

  "Aku akan meyakinkan mereka bahwa aku ingin menjadi peserta pertama dari 12 yang tinggal di Desa Pemenang.",
  "Aku hanyalah bocah berandalan yang mencoba kabur dari Penjaga Perdamaian, menantang Snow, dan meludah ke arah penonton sebagai tambahan.",

  "Brutally.",

  "The burn cream kept me from going off my head.”",
  "Her shirtsleeves have been cut off at the shoulder, and I note the burn marks on her arms, competing for space with the riding crop welts and a range of cuts and bruises, her skin a map of the abuse she’s suffered since the reaping.",
  "Who would’ve ever believed that coddled Maysilee Donner, of the nail polish and velvet bows, would come to this?",

  "",
  "The fake moon rises, casting a silvery light over our little clearing.",
  "I feel Maysilee a few feet away, sense her pulse, the rise and fall of her chest, but she seems as impermanent as the rest of it.",
  "Possibly I have died — by poisoning, in the tunnel, on Panache’s sword — and have moved on to one of Lenore Dove’s worlds, where I continue to dream of life.",
  "",
  "“Have you killed anyone besides Barba and Angler?”",

  "Trying to reach us, to let us know we are not alone in our pain, to give us strength to go on.",
  "Tears fill my eyes, forcing me to admit my presence in the only world I know.",
  "Not an imaginary one.",
  "The one where I am in the Hunger Games for real.",

  "Fifty-fifty.",
  "",
  "The night air feels chilly.",
  "Maysilee pulls her shirt down over her knees for warmth and hugs herself, but I can still see the gooseflesh on her arms.",
  "“I could make a fire if you’d like,” I offer.",
  "",
  "“That’d be good.",

  "",
  "The circles under her eyes say otherwise, but I’m fading fast.",
  "“Okay, but wake me anytime to take over.”",
  "I secure my flint striker around my neck, spread out my hammock on the ground, and stretch out, watching the tongues of fire dance.",
  "",
  "“Works better if you close your eyes,” she says.",
  "",
  "“Yeah.”",
  "I shift positions, but something seems unfinished.",
  "Like I never really thanked her for today.",
  "No, I did.",
  "With the juice.",
  "But that doesn’t begin to cover it.",
  "What do you say to the meanest girl in town who’s become your friend?",
  "No, more than a friend, really.",
  "A Newcomer.",
  "Being tributes and not killing each other . . . looking out for each other with no questions asked . . . that’s family, I guess.",

  "Maysilee has let me sleep most of the night.",
  "When we switch places, I’m determined to give her the same opportunity.",
  "Ax and knife at hand, I keep the fire burning with bits of fuel until the sun rises on our fifth day in the arena.",
  "My stomach growls so loud I’m afraid it might wake her.",
  "Last night’s soup seems a distant memory.",
  "I should be watching the woods, but my eyes keep drifting upward, hoping for a sponsor gift.",
  "Nothing would be too small, a piece of bread, a bit of cheese, and our water’s getting mighty low.",
  "",
  "I focus on my plan.",
  "Obviously, I was onto something with that hedge.",
  "They played me, but they also confirmed what I suspected.",
  "I’ve found the end of the arena.",
  "If I can get through the shrubbery, I’ll find the generator and try to hack it to bits.",
  "",
  "Time’s a-wasting, but Maysilee deserves some shut-eye.",
  "To distract myself, I pull her tarp out from under my butt and attempt to fashion it into some sort of gizmo to catch rainwater, in the event any more should fall.",
  "My efforts result in a crooked funnel of sorts, that I tie with vines at the point.",
  "Seems like something of an achievement, until I hear her laughter.",
  "",
  "“Made yourself a hat, did you?”",
  "",
  "I’m kind of glad just to hear her laugh.",
  "“This, I’ll have you know, is a first-class watercatcher.",

  "",
  "“Will I?",
  "Exactly how are all the raindrops supposed to find that tiny opening?”",
  "",
  "She has a point.",
  "There’s very little room for the rain to enter, which is no way to collect water.",
  "The water that fills our rain barrel has a roof to catch it before it finds its way down the drainpipe.",
  "“More surface area, you thinking?”",
  "",
  "“I’m thinking.”",
  "Maysilee holds out her hand for my funnel.",
  "She unwraps the tarp and flattens it out thoughtfully.",
  "It’s about four by four feet with little rings in the corners for securing it.",
  "“First, we’ll need some way to mount it.”",
  "She looks around, then gathers some vines.",
  "I help her tie them to the rings.",
  "She borrows my knife and punches a small hole in the very center of the tarp.",
  "“Now the water can run out there.",
  "Wish we had a tube of some kind; it would channel it into your jug.”",
  "",
  "We take inventory of our stuff, which seems fruitless until I spy the wineglass.",
  "I remember how the juice filled the entire stem.",
  "“How attached are you to this?”",
  "",
  "“Less attached than I am to water,” says Maysilee.",
  "",
  "Placing the glass carefully on the log, I chop off the base and the bowl, leaving a hollow glass tube.",
  "Maysilee slides it into the hole.",
  "The jagged glass does a nice job of holding it in place.",
  "",
  "“That should work,” she says.",
  "“Now all we need’s a rain shower.”",
  "She folds the tarp carefully and returns it to her pack.",
  "“So, what’s the plan?",
  "I was thinking we might go back to the Cornucopia to see if we can find any food that got left behind.",
  "Then we could go look for the other Newcomers.",
  "Or do you think we should find them first?”",
  "",
  "“I think we should head north.”",
  "",
  "“North?",

  "",
  "“Can we at least try to locate the Careers’ packs?",
  "They must’ve hidden them somewhere around here before they hunted you.”",
  "",
  "“Good thinking, but not for too long.",
  "Fifteen minutes and we go.”",
  "",
  "Maysilee gives me a probing look but begins the search.",
  "She suspected I wasn’t being up front with her back in the apartment.",
  "I don’t know if she credits me with the arena breakdown, but she knows something’s still up that I’m not sharing.",
  "Should I tell her?",
  "How?",
  "When?",
  "Those cameras have to be on us.",
  "",
  "We go back to the site of the fight and spiral out, looking for any supplies the Careers might have stashed.",
  "Sure enough, we find some tucked under a rock shelf, only a short distance away.",
  "Three backpacks of various sizes.",

  "A hammock like mine.",
  "Two empty water jugs.",
  "Three handkerchiefs.",
  "A bottle of syrupy medicine for when you’ve been poisoned.",
  "A second tarp.",

  "Maysilee raises her eyebrows.",
  "“Starting fires will be a cinch now.”",
  "",
  "Almost makes me sad, seeing Lenore Dove’s gift become obsolete so quickly.",

  "Is there an army of mutt wasps with wicked stingers?",

  "",
  "Porcupines inhabit the hills around 12.",
  "Lenore Dove has an affection for the ones back home — quill pigs she calls them — saying they’re misunderstood.",
  "They can’t shoot quills like people think; you have to come in contact with them, especially their tails, and if you leave them be, they leave you be.",
  "But even she would have trouble loving this massive mutant beast.",
  "It’s the size of a bear — in fact, it might have been crossed with one in the lab, given its claws and teeth.",
  "Like everything in the arena, it’s striking in its way.",
  "The rows of pure gold, silver, and bronze quills adorning its back, sides, and tail gleam in the sunlight.",
  "But I’m long over being seduced by the arena’s beauty.",
  "",
  "Distorted baby sounds continue to stream from its mouth as it snuffles around the clearing.",
  "Hull, who has a half dozen quills dangling from his swollen face, hollers as he lunges at it with a pitchfork.",

  "Hull could run away, but he’s trying to get to his allies.",

  "I suggest.",
  "Layered together, they feel a bit more secure.",

  "It has to make contact to quill us.”",
  "",
  "We weigh our options.",

  "He cries out in agony and sinks to the ground.",
  "I retrieve the branch and start snapping off the smaller shoots to streamline it into a staff.",
  "The sound draws the attention of the beast and it begins to clatter its teeth together.",
  "As it shifts in our direction and approaches, a stench of musk and roses washes over us, making my eyes water.",
  "",
  "Maysilee hoists the double tarp in front of us and we peer over it.",
  "“I don’t have a lot of confidence in this flipping thing,” she says.",
  "“And it’s still too far for darts.",

  "Can you throw it?”",
  "",
  "With the amount of kindling the world’s required of me, chopping wood for white liquor and laundry, I’ve messed around with axes plenty.",
  "This one’s on the long side and I’ve never practiced with it, though it’s not dissimilar to one I threw with Ringina back in training.",
  "",
  "“I can try,” I say.",
  "“But you better have those darts ready.”",
  "",
  "I shove my knife in my belt and get a double-handed grip on my ax, the way they said was best in the gym.",
  "“Okay, now.”",
  "As Maysilee lowers the tarps, I drop the ax back behind my head and then launch it at the porcupine.",
  "It makes one rotation before the blade buries itself in the beast’s side.",
  "",
  "A squeal of pain and indignation rings out.",
  "The mutt puts us squarely in line with its butt, but I’m not too worried because we still have ten feet between us.",
  "Then it begins to demonstrate some unusual behavior, quivering at first, which leads to it shaking like a wet dog.",
  "The quills shoot out in a sunburst, and Maysilee barely has time to yank the tarps back up before a dozen pierce them.",
  "One sticks the bulb of my nose and another comes a hair’s breadth from my pupil, dangerously close to blinding me.",
  "I jerk back and rip the quill from my nose.",
  "Tiny bits of my flesh cling to the barbed end, leaving a raw, stinging wound.",
  "",
  "Still keeping the tarps aloft, Maysilee removes a spike from her cheek with a wince.",
  "“Once again, you were misinformed.”",
  "",
  "“I’m sorry.",
  "Nothing behaves naturally here.”",
  "She turns the tarps ninety degrees to get the quills away from our eyes, and we peek over the top.",
  "I spot my ax lying on the ground, freed by the mutt’s shaking.",
  "“Think my ax did any damage?”",
  "",
  "“Hard to tell,” she says.",
  "",
  "The porcupine goes on the rampage, stamping its feet and fussing like a toddler having a meltdown.",
  "Only, I know it’s nobody’s baby, just an abomination whipped up in a test tube to murder us.",
  "It begins to shake again.",
  "We duck below the tarps for cover as another round of quills peppers us.",
  "",
  "A cannon sounds, and I know one of the Newcomers has gone.",
  "Two remain alive.",
  "I don’t know what poison the quills carry, but my nose has swelled up like a ripe strawberry.",
  "If we give them the antidote, could they recover still?",
  "Should I drink some now?",
  "Is one quill enough to kill you?",
  "",
  "“We need to get to them,” I tell Maysilee.",
  "“Try the antidote.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, but I don’t think your stick’s going to be of much use,” she says.",
  "",
  "“I don’t think anything’s going to be of much use since it can shoot those quills.”",
  "I watch the creature continue its tantrum and think of Sid when he was a little one.",
  "“Maybe we’re going about this all wrong.",
  "Maybe we should try soothing it.”",
  "",
  "“Soothing it?”",
  "",
  "“Yeah, like when you try to calm down a baby.",
  "And then just get it to move on.”",
  "",
  "“Sing it a lullaby maybe?”",
  "Maysilee deadpans.",
  "",
  "“Maybe,” I counter.",
  "“Or give it a pacifier.”",
  "",
  "“I guess you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.”",
  "Maysilee unearths the cans from her pack.",
  "“Olives or sardines?”",
  "",
  "“Well, the olives are easier to throw.”",
  "I pull one out and chuck it in front of the porcupine, which ignores it.",
  "I bounce a few more off its nose.",
  "The cries mellow to whimpers as it runs its snout along the forest floor, snarfing up the olives.",
  "“Who doesn’t love salt?”",
  "I lob another one a couple of feet ahead of the mutt, and it lumbers after it.",
  "Then another and another, stretching the distance each time, until I’ve got it ten yards outside the clearing.",
  "Out of olives, I throw the empty can as far into the woods as my strength allows and hear the porcupine crashing through the trees like a dog after a bone.",
  "",
  "A second cannon fires.",
  "Maysilee’s in the clearing in a flash, trying to tip the antidote between Hull’s lips.",
  "I check for Chicory’s and Buck’s pulses, just in case those cannons were for some unfortunate tribute elsewhere.",
  "Nothing.",
  "I join Maysilee, who’s managed to coax some of the syrup down Hull’s throat, and begin plucking quills from his leg to reduce the poison.",
  "",
  "“Come on, Hull,” she tells him.",
  "“You’ve got to drink this down.",
  "Come on, now.”",
  "He’s trying, his throat muscles rippling with the effort, but the antidote’s bubbling back and spilling down the side of his face.",
  "We continue, her coaxing, me plucking, until the cannon sounds, and even then, for a few minutes more because maybe someone as young and strong and deserving of life as Hull might find his way back to it.",
  "But he doesn’t and so, finally, we give up.",
  "",
  "The hovercraft approaches, a vulture hungry for the remains of our allies.",
  "From deep in the woods comes the sound of the porcupine chomping on the olive can, its targets long forgotten.",
  "Evening air cools my cheeks and diffuses the creature’s musk.",
  "Maysilee passes me the bottle and I take a swig of the antidote.",
  "I don’t know how much poison one quill delivers, but why take a chance?",
  "It tastes like somebody mixed chalk bits in buttermilk and forgot to stir it.",
  "",
  "Maysilee and I go around and shut each of the dead tributes’ eyes and try to arrange their bodies properly so their families’ last image won’t be of their contorted limbs.",
  "On our way out of the clearing, we collect the ax, our tarps, and their supplies.",
  "The claw begins its descent as we reach my backpack.",

  "Could someone have thrown it back?",
  "Doesn’t seem likely.",
  "I hop up, collect a nearby rock, and toss it at the generator, tracking its descent.",
  "A few yards above the machine, it inexplicably bounces back up to me, reversing its trajectory and landing right in my hand, a little warmer than before.",
  "It must be, it has to be, some sort of force field positioned over the generator.",
  "Easier than stretching a tarp, I guess.",
  "A way of protecting it from the elements, wildlife, and, as it turns out, a rascal of a tribute.",
  "I suppose it’s not impossible that a rebel might try to sabotage the thing, but it seems unlikely they’d make their way to the middle of nowhere.",
  "Although, here I am.",
  "But even if I dropped a boulder down there, I couldn’t touch the thing.",

  "That’s when I hear Maysilee begin to scream.",
  "In a flash, I’m on my feet and thrashing through the smoky tunnel in the hedge.",
  "I spy bright patches of pink up ahead, hear honking, not unlike Lenore Dove’s geese.",

  "",
  "The two dozen waterbirds remind me of ones I’ve seen at the lake.",
  "Long-legged.",

  "They dive again and again at Maysilee, who’s kneeling on the ground, trying to use a tarp as protection while she vehemently slices at them with her dagger.",
  "A couple of dead birds lie on the ground, but they have taken their toll.",
  "Blood blossoms from her cheek, her chest, the palm of her hand.",
  "Like Ampert’s squirrels, they have no interest in me.",
  "Programmed to target Maysilee in a very personal punishment.",
  "I hack away at the mutts with my ax, piling up a collection of rosy wings and legs like cattail stems, but they badly outnumber us.",
  "",
  "A bird swoops down at a sharp angle, driving its beak through her throat.",
  "As it withdraws, I decapitate it, slicing through the skinny neck.",
  "I realize Maysilee’s beyond recovery when the flock clears out.",
  "Falling to my knees beside her, I reach for her sound hand, which grasps mine like a vise.",
  "Her wounded one curls up and rests in her nest of necklaces, which lays in a pool of blood.",
  "Through the rasping of her breath, she attempts to speak, but the last mutt silenced her voice with its wicked beak.",
  "Mine seems silenced as well, as no words of comfort or hope or apology make it out.",
  "I just stare into those burning blue eyes, letting her know she’s not dying alone.",
  "She’s with family.",
  "She’s with me.",
  "",

  "",
  "She hasn’t begged or pleaded; she retained her fury and defiance.",
  "Although for me, a person’s desperation at the end is not a measure of their life, I know it mattered to her.",

  "I think about cleaning her up, but this is her final poster, and I won’t tidy it up to make it easier for those monsters in the Capitol to sleep tonight.",
  "",
  "The hovercraft slides into view and the cannon booms.",
  "I remove her blowgun and one of her necklaces — the copper medallion with the flower — as a reminder of her strength.",
  "",
  "Too numb to do much else, I scoot back about ten feet and prop myself against a tree, clutching her token to my chest.",
  "When the Capitol realizes I’m going nowhere, they lower the claw.",
  "I imagine the shot: my stricken face, visible through the metal talons as they lift Maysilee’s body up into the sky, leaving me all alone.",
  "",
  "If something attacked me right now, I’d let it take me.",
  "I know, I know, I just made a deathbed promise to Maysilee to carry on the fight, but I can’t seem to rally.",
  "I pat her necklace against my pants to wipe off the blood — these black clothes just never stop giving — and hook the fancy clasp behind my neck to hang there with its friends.",
  "I’ve got my own jewelry collection now, what with District 9’s sunflower, Wyatt’s scrip coin, and Lenore Dove’s warring songbird and snake.",
  "Why, I’m almost as decorated as Miss Donner herself.",
  "",
  "The blowgun seems loaded with a single dart.",
  "I dropped the ball not taking the pouch and poison vial, but at least I’ve got one shot.",

  "When I open the attached basket, I find two containers.",
  "A basin holds strawberry ice cream, which seems like it ought to have some significance I can’t pinpoint at the moment.",
  "The second, a lidded mug, holds steaming black coffee.",
  "Maysilee’s beverage of choice.",
  "I take a sip, scalding my tongue.",
  "Then another.",
  "",
  "The ice cream jogs my memory.",
  "We’re in the kitchen at the tribute apartment and Proserpina’s been blubbering about her grade.",
  "Her sister, Effie, told her a positive attitude’s ninety-seven percent of the battle.",
  "And Maysilee . . .",
  "Maysilee had said . . .",
  "",
  "“I’ll try to keep that in mind in the arena.",
  "More ice cream?”",

  "Mags and I tried not to laugh, because Proserpina wasn’t born evil; she just had a lot of unlearning to do.",
  "I’m not sure what Mags is trying to impart now.",
  "A directive to stay positive?",
  "A reminder of Maysilee’s sass?",
  "Just a delicious bowl of ice cream?",
  "Maybe all three.",
  "I pick up the spoon and take a bite.",
  "Tears come, and I let them fall, unchecked, while I empty the basin.",
  "It’s okay to cry around Mags.",
  "",
  "The sun closes in on the horizon as I slowly sip the cooling coffee, which helps to clear my head.",
  "There’s no Maysilee left to protect now.",
  "I guess I should return to the cliff for my final poster.",
  "I decide to consolidate my remaining supplies in Maysilee’s backpack.",
  "I add a half jug of water and store the potatoes in the basin for safekeeping.",
  "As I tuck in the spare handkerchiefs, I notice a slit in the interior wall of her pack.",
  "Wiggling my fingers through the opening, I encounter a bumpy plastic pack.",
  "I’d forgotten about the potato-light kit.",
  "I guess she didn’t reveal it when we inventoried our supplies since it wasn’t legal.",
  "Not that that much worries me now.",
  "So much has gone down with blown-up tanks and dead Gamemakers that a few rogue wires and coins hardly seem worth mentioning.",
  "",
  "I start thinking about the Gamemakers we encountered.",
  "They were none of them very old.",
  "The guy with the mop, early twenties tops.",
  "Were their deaths painful?",
  "Do they leave people behind?",
  "Are their parents, friends, and neighbors weeping for them as ours do when they lose us?",
  "Will their loved ones ever know how they really died, or will an accident be fabricated to conceal the Capitol’s incompetence?",
  "Body doubles probably won’t be practical.",
  "",
  "As I stow my green pack in the bushes, the oppressive opening notes of the anthem drone from the sky.",
  "First there’s Maritte, then Maysilee.",
  "Doesn’t seem random.",
  "They’ve been eliminated swiftly, in punishment for killing their keepers.",
  "By abstaining, Silka and I have been rewarded with a few more hours of life.",
  "",
  "And what about Wellie?",
  "I haven’t had time to focus on her much, but she’s out there, too.",
  "Maysilee indicated that if neither of us survived, it could work for Wellie to carry on the fight.",
  "I think about how poised and articulate she was at the interview.",
  "She’d be a far better, far smarter, far more convincing victor to represent district rights than a cocky, selfish rascal, even if he had a chance of surviving, which he doesn’t.",
  "Is that what my final hours should be devoted to?",
  "Guarding Wellie from Silka and the Gamemakers’ mutts?",
  "Making sure that crown winds up on her head, not a Career’s?",
  "Yes, I’m certain this is what Maysilee would’ve wanted me to do, if she’d known the whole story.",
  "",
  "If I’m going to protect Wellie, I’m going to have to find her.",
  "Really, at this point, there’s only one way.",

  "“Wellie!”",
  "I holler.",
  "“Wellie!”",

  "In the fading rays of the sun, I begin my search, heading south toward the meadow.",
  "Seems so lonely here without Maysilee.",
  "I didn’t notice the solitude so much before I had her as a partner, but now the darkness presses in on me, raw and scary.",
  "",
  "“Wellie!”",
  "",
  "Feels like I’m the only person left alive in the world.",
  "Being close to death doesn’t help.",
  "I reach for Lenore Dove for solace, knowing she must be keeping vigil at her television set, living through my last hours with me.",
  "It’s much worse for her, really.",
  "The helplessness.",
  "Thinking of her watching me makes me want to be brave, or at least appear to be.",
  "“Wellie!",
  "Where are you?",
  "It’s Haymitch!”",
  "I hope Lenore Dove will stay close to Sid when I’m gone, keep teaching him the stars and things, making sure he isn’t —",

  "There it is again.",
  "Not natural.",
  "Man-made.",
  "Decidedly metal on metal.",
  "I know that sound from a summer day long ago.",
  "I was still young enough to have free time.",
  "A bunch of us — me, Lenore Dove, Blair, Burdock, and a couple of the McCoy kids — were playing freeze tag in a field.",
  "We stumbled upon a Peacekeeper’s bicycle hidden in the bramble bushes by the road.",
  "Sometimes they use them to get around town, deliver messages and such.",
  "Looked like someone had dropped it quick and was probably coming back for it.",
  "But in the meantime, it was ours.",
  "",
  "Bicycles are coveted in District 12.",
  "A few of the merchants’ kids in town have them.",
  "I remember Maysilee and Merrilee had matching pink ones, and sometimes rode them around the square to the envy of all.",
  "But they were a pipe dream for kids in the Seam.",
  "For us to find a Peacekeeper’s bike so shiny and unattended was like a litter of kittens rolling smack-dab into a patch of catnip.",
  "We swore one another to secrecy, posted guards, and for the next week, every one of us learned to ride.",
  "It was a fine machine, well built, smooth, with brakes on the handlebars and a bright silver bell to signal your approach.",
  "It disappeared then; probably the Peacekeeper came back to collect it, but it had never been ours to keep.",
  "",
  "Ring, ring!",
  "",
  "That’s a bicycle bell, beyond a doubt.",
  "The one Maysilee wove into Wellie’s token necklace back in the gym.",
  "She’s heard my calls and this is her answer.",
  "I shut up and follow the bell.",
  "It leads back north.",
  "I feel like I’m retracing my steps to where Maysilee died.",
  "",
  "Ring, ring!",

  "I come to a halt at the base of a large tree.",
  "The bell gives a tinny ring from on high.",
  "“It’s okay, Wellie,” I say.",
  "“I’m here.",
  "You can come down.”",
  "I wait, but there’s no response.",
  "No crackling of branches or rustling of leaves.",
  "Not a whisper from my ally.",
  "“Wellie?",
  "You there?”",
  "The only possible alternative, Silka, does not impress me as someone who could scamper up as high as I judge that bell to be.",
  "And if Silka had gotten close enough to steal Wellie’s token, I’d have seen another dove in the sky.",
  "I begin to climb.",
  "",
  "Up, up, up I go, so far that I begin to wonder if I have the right tree.",
  "The boughs thin out, and I have to plant my boots against the trunk or risk snapping them off.",
  "When I do reach her, she’s so still that I almost miss her.",
  "She lies along a slender branch, belly down, like a possum in the moonlight, her bell tucked under her chin, a child-sized knife clutched in one hand.",
  "",
  "“Hey, Wellie.”",
  "",
  "Her cracked lips move slightly, but no sound comes out.",
  "She has the shrunken, glassy-eyed look I know from tough times in the Seam.",
  "Another casualty of the Capitol’s weapon of choice: starvation.",
  "I need to move her down before she rolls right off that branch and get some food into her.",
  "But she’s so fragile, I don’t see how I can manage it, especially at night.",
  "I give her a sip of water from the jug, and it spills out the side of her mouth.",
  "There’s no way I’m getting raw potato down her.",
  "",
  "I stay with the water.",
  "“Try to swallow it, Wellie,” I plead.",
  "She manages to get down a few mouthfuls and then drifts off.",
  "",
  "The moon slips behind a cloud, leaving us momentarily in darkness, and I hug the trunk for stability until the pale light returns.",
  "The air seems to be growing heavier in general; are they prepping a rainstorm?",
  "The idea of being trapped up this high in the pitch black while the bark gets slippery scares me, but I can’t abandon Wellie.",
  "I could get some sparks going with my flint striker, but how would I build a fire up here?",
  "I fumble around in Maysilee’s pack, looking for something to use as fuel, when I come upon the potato battery kit.",
  "Theoretically, I could make my own light.",
  "It probably wouldn’t produce much if it did, but it might be of some comfort.",
  "",
  "A faint rumble of thunder prompts me to try.",
  "I wedge myself awkwardly between the trunk and a branch and use the backpack as my worktable.",
  "Beetee said that a potato shouldn’t be eaten after it was a battery, so I restrict myself to using one, saving the last for Wellie’s breakfast.",
  "I cut a potato in half, remove each component from the plastic bag, and strain to replicate Beetee’s demonstration.",
  "Wrap the copper coins and zinc nails in wire, leaving a tail, and stick them in the potato halves.",
  "This takes a while given the limited light.",
  "There’s a bad moment when one of the coins slips through my fingers and escapes to the forest floor.",
  "I’m about to give up when I remember Maysilee’s medallion and work it out of the woven cord.",
  "After more than a few false starts, I attach the final wire to a tiny light bulb and am rewarded with a dim glow.",
  "In most circumstances, it would be negligible, but in the gloom of the arena, it feels like life itself.",
  "Wellie’s eyes flutter open, lock on it, and she gives a little sigh.",
  "",
  "The first raindrops patter onto the leaves while I’m looking for somewhere close by to rig a hammock.",
  "The branches don’t feel sturdy enough.",
  "Instead, I position a tarp to keep Wellie dry and wrap Maysilee’s blanket around her multiple times.",
  "I cut off some strips of tarp and tie them along her legs and midsection, securing her to the branch.",
  "She doesn’t seem to notice, just fixates on her light.",

  "No moving her until morning, so I arrange a second tarp and a few straps for myself.",
  "It rains cats and dogs for a while, turns misty, and then the clouds withdraw.",

  "The parachute brings a cup of warm vanilla pudding and a packet of balls, each wrapped in crinkly festive paper.",
  "Chocolate.",

  "Someone in the Capitol still has a heart.",
  "",
  "With patience, I coax the pudding into Wellie, bit by bit.",
  "And although we lose half to dribbles, the other half makes it into her belly.",

  "I’m pretty sure The Hunger Games wouldn’t exist without Jim (which is why the first book is dedicated to him).",
  "We met on Generation O!, an animated TV show that he cocreated.",
  "Jim thought I should be an author and repeatedly encouraged me to give it a try.",
  "He said to write something, anything, and then he’d do a few drawings for it and his agent, Rosemary Stimola, would have to look at it.",
  "So that’s how it started.",
  "Neither the ABC or counting books we attempted ever found a home — although Jim’s art was fantastic.",
  "But they gave me enough of a connection to Rosemary that on the morning I woke up in a state of excitement with the idea for Gregor the Overlander, I felt comfortable calling her at an inappropriately early hour and pitching it.",
  "The rest unfolded from there.",
  "It seems unlikely that I would’ve found my way to books without Jim, and I will always be grateful to him for opening that door and quietly and persistently nudging me through it.",

  "Jim was one of the truly original thinkers it has been my privilege to work with.",
  "We collaborated on a number of TV projects, but only one other book.",
  "I had been struggling to find a way to transform my memories of the year my dad was deployed to Vietnam into a picture book.",
  "Over a casual lunch, I started telling Jim the story.",
  "As he responded, I began to see it come to life with his art, not dark and heavy-handed but through the eyes of a six-year-old.",
  "Year of the Jungle was a tough story for me to tell, far more personal than my usual writing, and having an empathetic and trusted friend by my side gave me the courage to explore it.",
  "His incredible art, which transforms the jungle from a magical playground to a terrifying nightmare while maintaining a childlike visual style, made the book possible.",
  "",
  "For the encouragement, for the jungle, and for the many years of your kindness, humor, patience, talent, and friendship, thank you, Jim.",

  "In addition, I’d like to thank my gander and first reader, Cap Pryor; my son, Charlie; and my aforementioned agent, Rosemary, for their impactful early response to this book.",
